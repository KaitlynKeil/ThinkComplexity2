Kniveton, Smith, and Wood use an agent-based model to examine how climate change may effect human migration. They focus on a population based on Burkina Faso, as an area heavily influenced by climate change. They attempt to replicate the flows from the period 1970-2000, then predict out until 2060. Their agents make the decision to move based upon a variety of drivers, including rainfall, place of birth, current age, peer opinions, and current assets. As agents migrate and sometimes return, the peer opinions variable changes, which drives others to migrate or stay. Their model slightly underestimates total migration flux from the observed data, but follows the general trend. They predict an increasing flux for the coming years, particularly for a dry climate scenario.

With this project, we could potentially add target locations that have slightly different attributes the migrants might go towards--cost of living, current immigrant population, political atmosphere--which would allow us to model the patterns of migration to specific places as well. In theory, we could then use this to prepare accommodations for climate change refugees.
