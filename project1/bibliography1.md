[Concurrency-Induced Transitions in Epidemic Dynamics on Temporal Networks](https://comdig.unam.mx/2017/09/10/concurrency-induced-transitions-in-epidemic-dynamics-on-temporal-networks/); *Onaga, Tomokatsu; Gleeson, James P.; and Masuda, Naoki; **Physical Review Letters** (6 Sept 2017) 119, 108301.*

In their article, Onaga, Gleeson, and Masuda examine how epidemics (both in physical and viral information space) spread over dynamic, or temporal, networks. They construct these networks through graphs of certain connectivity which discard their edges after a certain time period before being activated and reconnected. Each node has a certain activity potential to represent an individual's tendency to make connections. Through a simulation that combines this model and continuous-time susceptible-infected-susceptible modeling, they predict the pattern of epidemic spread and show that high nodal concurrency enhances epidemics. This model could be extended to examine the effects of two mutually exclusive epidemics with either similar or different connectivity.
