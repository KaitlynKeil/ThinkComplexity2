The authors of this paper modeled the development of communities in situations where interactions occur regularly with the same nodes and situations where interactions occur between random nodes. This was represented by networks where deals were made between nodes, where some nodes were responders and some were proposers. Proposers would make an offer (p where 0<=p<=100) to all surrounding responders, who would give a minimum acceptance level (q where 0<=q<=100). In some networks, the nodes and their connections were set; in others, the offers were made between random nodes, changed each time. When nodes make deals, the they p value starts to become their 'community'. They found that communities emerged among the static networks, but not among the random groups. This was done in four groups with a random number of rounds to confirm the results. Because this was largely modeled with human subjects, figuring out how to model this via computer, perhaps by giving extra weight in random choice for p and q values that have sucessfully made a deal.
